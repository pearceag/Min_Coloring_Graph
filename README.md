Input syntax - shown in sample_in.txt:

4            - number of verticies / lines to read in 
1 2 3 4      - vertice followed by connected verticies
2 4
3 4
4 1

to run tests 
in terminal run: 
    for exact code: python3 min_colors_exact.py<sample_in.txt
        where sample_in.txt is the test file 
    for approximation: min_colors_approx.py<sample_in.txt

Expected Output:found in file with the same name as the input but with _out instead of _in:
    sample_out.txt

Min Coloring Graph: The Graph Coloring decision problem is np-complete, asking for existence of a coloring with less than 'q' colors, as given a coloring , it can be easily checked in polynomial time, whether or not it uses less than 'q' colors
